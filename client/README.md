# Library Book Management - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Library Book Management application built using React. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the frontend up and running locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/medheerajput/library-book-management-frontend.git
    cd library-book-management-frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variable:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

    Replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with the URL of your backend API if itâ€™s running on a different port or URL.

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
